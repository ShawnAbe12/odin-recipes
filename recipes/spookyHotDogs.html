    <br>
    <p>These Halloween hot dogs use crescent rolls to make a spooky twist on pigs in a blanket. 
        <br>Kids love them. Plus, they are an easy snack for a holiday party.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can refrigerated crescent rolls</li>

         <li>  8 hot dogs</li> 
            
         <li>  2 tablespoons ketchup, or to taste</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Unroll crescent dough. Pinch or press the perforation between the triangles to get four rectangular pieces.<br> Cut rectangles in half lengthwise, making eight narrow strips.</li>
        <li>Make a 2-inch slice through the center of one end of a hot dog. <br>Cut two more 2-inch slices on either side of that slice, so the "legs" are about the same thickness. Repeat on other end. Cut "legs" into remaining hot dogs.</li>
        <li>Roll a crescent strip around center of each dog.Place spider dogs on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 11 minutes.<br>Dip a chopstick into some ketchup and dot "eyes" onto each spider. Serve with remaining ketchup.</li>
